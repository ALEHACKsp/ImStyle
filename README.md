ImStyle
=====
[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) style editor tool and a single header for loading and saving your styles in ini files

Requires [sini](https://github.com/ShrewdSpirit/Sini) and C++11. You just have to include ImStyle.hpp ;)

If you want to build the editor too, you have to create a project with test.cpp and use [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) and [sfml-imgui](https://github.com/ShrewdSpirit/sfml-imgui) libraries.
